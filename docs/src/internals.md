# Architecture and validation

The twelve active files are module/types/blocks/line_searches/solve/utils/precompile,
solvers/image_models and proximal_gradient_descent, and cd/models/solver/leastsquares.
Small native helpers support two separately cached algorithms and existing
result types. CDModel and state hooks are private extraction/test seams, not
promises of custom loss or workspace support. Generic block/metric/certificate/
logging frameworks are deferred.

The dense and `SparseIterate` entry points of CD share one private run on a
PB SparseIterate (model, state, passes, warning and finite-objective check). The
dense wrapper builds that iterate from the vector and scatters the result back.
The owner wrapper copies the caller's owner with `copy`, runs on the copy and
commits with a same-shape `copyto!` through PB's public storage methods only,
after the finite-objective check; it does not rebuild through a dense vector, so
active zeros and slot order survive both ways. Validation is split into data
checks shared by both gates and an owner gate that inspects only public active
values and tests aliasing against the original owner. PGD keeps the dense gate and
refuses owners.

The current exact PB pin is c123d56ba1948e36a8fdbf183a9eea396a16e0d5. CD uses
its scalar `prox_block` oracle; PGD retains fused `value_and_prox!`. The private PB
SparseIterate contract remains unchanged. PR #237's group/workspace migration is
not imported. The gated analysis job always runs isolated exact-source paired
diagnostics against PB A e8a45a8a6ffe2a6f92d83c4c77d62a9b7631e291 and frozen
PS 64930401cfc0451e886728d916263c4dab2baf36, including when package tests are
not selected or reused. Loaded paths, clean Git HEADs and source digests are
checked; version strings never skip probes. C0 and the provenance audit describe
the independent full-suite mathematical/behavioral tests.

Current CI is stable Julia1 Linux x64 only for every tier. Preserve required
checks, full master validation, coverage, benchmark-analysis and conservative
policy-aware nightly reuse. Historical platform runs and the deferred macOS C0
warm-convergence failure remain historical, not newly passing claims.

Historical measured performance tables remain in the repository's
[full-package performance record](https://github.com/mlakolar/ProximalSolvers.jl/blob/master/docs/audit/historical-full-performance.md).
They are not replaced by unmeasured minimal-core claims.
